# Web Mining project

We implemented an interactive web application using `Streamlit` that acts as a dynamic dashboard for crisis-related tweets. The system loads data from JSON files representing nodes in a social graph (tweets and events). Each tweet is associated with a specific event via a shared `topic` and `trecisid`.
